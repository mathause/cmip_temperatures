# Mean temperature anomalies for CMIP5 and CMIP6

Document raw (unassessed) mean temperature anomalies for time periods in cmip5 and cmip6 data. Check the [global warming levels](https://github.com/mathause/cmip_warming_levels) repository for a list of the year when a certain global warming level is reached.

:warning: Version 0.1.0 had an issue with the 10-year means (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)). This is fixed in version 0.2.1.

## Individual models

Temperature anomalies for individual models can be found in separate folders for [cmip6](temperatures/cmip6/csv/) and [cmip5](temperatures/cmip5/csv/)

### Example
The data is available in csv files:
``` csv
model, ens, exp, postprocess, table, grid, varn, period, mean
CAMS-CSM1-0, r1i1p1f1, ssp119, global_mean, Amon, gn, tas, 2021-2040, 1.07
CNRM-ESM2-1, r1i1p1f2, ssp119, global_mean, Amon, gr, tas, 2021-2040, 1.32
CanESM5, r1i1p1f1, ssp119, global_mean, Amon, gn, tas, 2021-2040, 2.16
...
```

### Files

There are two files with [cmip6](temperatures/cmip6/csv/) data. One with one ensemble member per model and one with all ensemble members. For [cmip5](temperatures/cmip5/csv/) two additional files are provided. The reference period is 1850 to 1900, however, many cmip5 models only start after 1850 and are therefore excluded. These models are also included in the `*_no_bounds_check.yml` files.

## Data
 * Monthly temperature data (variable: `tas`, Table ID: `Lmon`) for `historical` and
   * `RCP2.6`, `RCP4.5`, `RCP6.0`, and `RCP8.5` (CMIP5)
   * `SSP1-1.9`, `SSP1-2.6`, `SSP2-4.5`, `SSP3-7.0`, and `SSP5-8.5` (CMIP6)
 * Grid-cell area for atmospheric grid variables (`areacella`)

## Method
To calculate the temperature anomalies the following method is used for every individual model:
 1. Calculate global mean temperature (weighted with the grid cell area (`areacella`) if available, else the `cos` of the latitude is used)
 2. Calculate annual mean (Note: all months are weighted equally)
 3. Concatenate historical data and projection (constrained to the historical/ future time period)
 4. Subtract the mean over 1850 to 1900 (inclusive)
 5. Calculate the mean over the indicated time period

## Code
The code will be published in https://github.com/IPCC-WG1 as soon as I have the right to create a repository.
